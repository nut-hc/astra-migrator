Vegas may be best known as a sexy, sinful, adults-only playground, but it can also be a place for family fun, and the Excalibur epitomizes this hybrid. It is definitely one of the kid-friendlier options on the Strip, and the 3,981-room hotel is a bit cheesy, with architecture that is themed to the max. The arches over the cabstand are outfitted with mock wooden portcullises, while suits of armor, stained-glass windows, and medieval-style chandeliers adorn the entrances. Signboards proclaim, \""Welcome to Excalibur. You Rule.\"" (The hotel shows some restraint in staff uniforms, however; staffers dress in sports coats and ties, not medieval garb.)</p>\n<p>The castle motif tends to be a hit with children, who can be seen bustling around the casino floor and the mezzanine-level food court. At the pool, parents tend to their water-wing-clad children in the shallow end, and kids flock to the waterslide. A healthy contingent of young adults stay at the Excalibur, too, drawn by its affordable rates -- some of the most competitive on the Strip. The entertainment offerings illustrate the hotel's split clientele; families might enjoy the Arthurian-themed dinner show, while bachelorette parties can hit up Thunder Down Under, known for its scantily clad male dancers.</p>\n<p>The Excalibur is typically a more affordable alternative to other themed Las Vegas properties like the <a href=\""https://www.oyster.com/las-vegas/hotels/new-york-new-york-hotel-and-casino/\"">New York-New York Hotel and Casino</a> and <a href=\""https://www.oyster.com/the-strip/hotels/luxor-hotel-and-casino/\"">Luxor Las Vegas</a>.

Compared with its neighbor, <a href=\""/jamaica/hotels/couples-swept-away/\"">Couples Swept Away</a>, Couples Negril is lacking the famed Seven Mile Beach location, instead sitting just north on the quieter sands of Bloody Bay -- a plus for travelers looking for a mellower beach vibe. Additionally, Couples Negril’s lower capacity makes for slightly reduced crowds (though because it's smaller, the property has fewer features than its neighbor). Ultimately, it’s a matter of taste -- and perhaps cost: Couples Negril is consistently cheaper than its neighbor, though not by much.</p><p>Comparisons aside, Couples Negril is aptly named, focusing on romance and adult-themed features, such as candlelit private beachfront dinners, tree-house-style treatment room at the spa, and banners across couples’ doors announcing their honeymoon or anniversary status. Though Couples Negril is more lovey-dovey and less risqué than other adult-only resorts such as the nearby <a href=\""/jamaica/hotels/grand-lido-negril-au-naturel-all-suite-resort/\"">Grand Lido</a>, it does provide a separate nude beach area with its own hot tub and bar. Most guests, however, tend to hang out at the main pool with a swim-up bar or the adjacent beach, and the vibe is largely laid-back. Grounds are lovely and lush, and seafoam-green walls, large hanging tapestries, and hot-pink cushions in the lobby create a fun look that stands out among the many neutral-tone cookie-cutter properties in Jamaica.</p><p>Those who wish to take advantage of the truly all-inclusive amenities at Couples Negril will be busy indeed, as water sports (even scuba diving), excursions, including glass-bottom boat tours and catamaran cruises, fitness classes and tennis lessons, and nightly entertainment are all free. It’s not all top-notch though, as the entertainment tends to be dull and even cheesy, food receives mixed reviews, and the “free” golf actually requires guests to rent clubs and a caddy on their own dime. Nevertheless, this is an excellent choice for couples. Couples wanting a larger property may prefer <a href=\""/jamaica/hotels/sandals-negril-beach-resort-and-spa/\"">Sandals Negril Beach Resort &amp; Spa</a>, while families should consider <a href=\""/jamaica/hotels/beaches-negril-resort-and-spa/\"">Beaches Negril Resort &amp; Spa</a>.</p>""},{""title"":""Location"",""subHeading"":"""",""summary"":""Just north of Negril’s famed Seven Mile Beach on a quiet bay"",""image"":{""postId"":false,""url"":""""},""content"":""<p>Bloody Bay may not sound like the most romantic place in the world, but the small inlet just north of Negril’s famous resort-lined Seven Mile Beach is a slightly less congested version of its bigger-name neighbor.

Adding to the teeming nightlife of the Roosevelt is The Spare Room--touted as a modern day gambling and cocktail lounge.

The hotel’s six-and-a-half acre gorgeous oceanfront &nbsp;grounds are full of blossoming flowers, palm trees, a huge man-made waterfall, and ponds full of colorful reef fish and a green sea turtle. There’s also a huge lagoon with Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (part of the on-site interactive dolphin experience). With this as its backdrop, it’s no surprise the hotel’s been a celebrity magnet since day one. A-listers like John Wayne, Dolly Parton, Michael Jackson, Elton John, and Snoop Dogg have stayed here. Every president since Lyndon B. Johnson (with the exception of President Trump) has been a Kahala guest. Even the '80s TV series \""Magnum P.I.\""’s beach bar was set at the hotel. Cascading chandeliers hang from the bright, airy lobby’s double-high ceilings. Just past it is a long patio with panoramic views of the hotel grounds and beach. For a pricy property, the hotel has a calm, unpretentious atmosphere -- except at the pool. The hotel attracts quite a few families and while there is a dedicated kids' pool, it’s small and kids inevitably migrate to the bigger main pool right next door.

The nearest mall has a grocery store, movie theater, and restaurants (fast food and middle eastern fare) and is a five-minute drive away. Diamond Head State Monument, a crater park that defines Oahu’s eastern shoreline, with fabulous views of Waikiki and Honolulu from its peak, is an eight-minute drive from The Kahala. The Hanauma Bay State Nature Preserve has a gorgeous sandy beach and a thriving snorkeling reef that take a 19-minute ride to reach. It's 24 minutes to Makapu‘u Point Lighthouse Trail (with its similarly-named lighthouse) that traces the side of a steep cliff for gorgeous ocean views and whale watching in season.

The oceanfront (and casual) Plumeria Beach House serves an international breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It also serves buffet breakfasts and buffet lunches and seafood dinners (on scheduled days). Also oceanfront, Seaside Grill serves sandwiches and quick bites. Hokus is the dinner (and weekend brunch spot) with a fusion of Hawaiian, Mediterranean, and European menus.

The concierge can arrange babysitters, car rentals, dining reservations, taxis, tickets, tours, activities, and airport transfers.
